# All about us

## Project organisation and goals

The Bovine Pan-Genome Consortium is an international scientific research
collaboration that was designed to organize 
[bovid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovidae) genome assembly efforts. 
Our goals are to provide the sequencing resources and bioinformatics expertise 
to collaborative groups interested in generating an assembly of their favorite 
species or breed of Bovidae.

The creation of reference-quality genome assemblies based on long-read platforms
has recently become sufficiently cost-effective to consider generating at least 
one example for many of the over 700 existing cattle breeds, and other species 
in the Bovidae phylogeny. We have applied both
[Pacific Biosciences Sequel](https://www.pacb.com/) and 
[Oxford Nanopore PromethION](https://nanoporetech.com/)
instruments to demonstrate successful high-quality 
assemblies of several breeds, species, and hybrids. We pioneered a method to 
create the highest-quality assemblies, called
[trio-binning](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4277), which depends on F1 
crosses between breeds and sampling of the parents. Where possible, this is the 
most efficient method since one can achieve very high contiguity for two breeds 
from sequencing reads of the F1. High quality assemblies, albeit less efficient,
can also be generated from individual breeds where creation of F1 and sampling 
of parents is not feasible or practical.

## Project Goals

- Generate high-quality (haplotype-resolved) references for bovid species
- Identify species-specific genetic loci
- Enhance genomic tools and resources for bovids
