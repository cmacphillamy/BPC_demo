# Data Ownership

If you contribute samples to our consortium, you own the assemblies, 
data and analysis. All that we ask in return is acknowledgment on your future 
projects/publications.

To facilitate our overall project goals, we will ask your permission to use the 
assemblies we generate in our priority comparative genomics project, and we will
grant you acknowledgment as a full-fledged consortium member in the publication.
