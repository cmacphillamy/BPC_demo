# Data-Rights

## Contributors' rights and responsibilities

The BPC assumes no rights or privileges over samples contributed by 
collaborators, apart from the request that research results are made 
public so as to benefit the greater cattle research community.

As the members of the Steering Committee, we pledge to honor the rights of 
contributors to publish their results separately from the Consortium, so as to 
promote the cooperation of institutions and agencies that often do not have the 
resources to engage in projects of this nature.

Our over-arching goal is to benefit the international cattle research community,
and the publication of diverse, representative reference genomes is more likely 
to result in a successful outcome.
